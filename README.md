# Automated_Standardization_College_Data
Project: US News and World Report Best Colleges ranking
Client: Chancellor’s Office of Data Analytics (CODA)

Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to develop a method for detecting the differences and similarities between the standardized names and the raw names of schools and ranking metrics in the US News and World Report Best Colleges ranking. The goal is to create a system that can recommend top matches and standardized names for schools and metrics that have different naming conventions across different ranking issues.

Data:

There are two datasets provided for this project. The first dataset is the longitudinal US News ranking data that CODA compiled over the years, which includes all ranking component metrics, overall rank, and overall score for all national universities from ranking issue year 2014 to 2022. The second dataset is the raw data extracted from the Academic Insights portal, which includes both historical issue years (1990 – 2022) and the latest issue year (2023).

Tasks:

The main tasks of this project are:

Append the latest 2023 data into the first dataset.
Develop a method to automatically detect top matches and provide recommendations for name standardization for schools and ranking metrics with different naming conventions across different ranking issues.
Approach:

To accomplish these tasks, the following steps will be taken:

Data Cleaning and Standardization:
The raw data extracted from the Academic Insights portal will be cleaned and standardized to match the format of the first dataset.
A standardized naming convention will be developed for schools and ranking metrics.
Data Integration:
The latest 2023 data will be appended into the first dataset.
Name Matching and Standardization:
A method will be developed to detect the differences and similarities between the standardized names and the raw names of schools and ranking metrics.
The method will recommend top matches and standardized names for schools and metrics that have different naming conventions across different ranking issues.
Documentation:
The code, methodology, and results will be documented thoroughly for reproducibility and transparency.
Conclusion:

The outcome of this project will be a system that can automatically detect the differences and similarities between the standardized names and the raw names of schools and ranking metrics, and provide recommendations for name standardization. This system will be useful for CODA in compiling longitudinal datasets and aggregations by school or metric for the US News and World Report Best Colleges ranking.
